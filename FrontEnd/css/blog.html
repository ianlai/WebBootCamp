                What am I missing OR what is a better option for me to control my system using the proxy. Once I get home I typically have to disable these proxies. Is there a truly system-wide way to make it use a proxy and then disable the proxy with a single command or click?

                First of all, be sure you have node.js installed in order to run the beautifier. After you've installed node.js, you will need to setup this plugin. Each OS has a different Packages folder required by Sublime Text. Open it via Preferences -> Browse Packages, and copy this repository contents to the Sublime-HTMLPrettify folder there.

                How do I set a default filetype for a certain file extension in Sublime Text 2? Specifically I want to have *.cfg files default to having Ini syntax highlighting but I cannot seem to figure out how I could create this custom setting.</p>
